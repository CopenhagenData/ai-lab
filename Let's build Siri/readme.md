# Introduction
To code our first Siri applicaiton, we only need 3 building blocks
1. A speech-to-text block, that listens to what we say and convert it into text
2. A chat-bot block that send our message to a robot that can return an answer
3. A speech-synthesis block, that can convert the returned answer, into speech

All the building blocks need to be combined into one programme.
